This project is a simple REST API built using Node.js, Express, and MySQL, tested with Thunder Client in VS Code. To set it up, first create a project folder using CMD or PowerShell and move into it, then initialize it by typing npm init -y and install the required dependencies by running npm install express mysql2 body-parser. Next, install XAMPP and make sure Apache and MySQL are running from the XAMPP Control Panel before starting the server. Open phpMyAdmin and create a database called rest_appi using the command CREATE DATABASE rest_appi; and select it with USE rest_appi;. Inside this database, create a users table with columns for id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, date_of_birth, and created_at using the SQL command CREATE TABLE users (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL UNIQUE, phone VARCHAR(15), date_of_birth DATE, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);. After creating the database and table, clone or download this repository and open it in VS Code. Ensure Node.js is installed so you can run commands in CMD (recommended if PowerShell has issues). To start the server, type node server.js in the terminal while XAMPP is running. If everything is set up correctly, the server will connect to MySQL and run at http://localhost:3000. To test the API, install the Thunder Client extension in VS Code, create a POST request to http://localhost:3000/users, go to the Body tab, select JSON, and enter user details such as first_name, last_name, email, phone, and date_of_birth, then click Send to save the user. To confirm that the data was saved, create a GET request to http://localhost:3000/users and click Send, which will return all users stored in the database, confirming that the API is working and saving data successfully.
