This project is a simple REST API built using Node.js, Express, and MySQL, tested with Thunder Client in VS Code. To set it up, first create a project folder using CMD or PowerShell, move into it, and initialize it by typing npm init -y. Then install the dependencies by running npm install express mysql2 body-parser. After that, install XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel, then open phpMyAdmin and create a database called rest_api with a users table that has columns for id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, date_of_birth, and created_at. Next, clone or download this repository, open it in VS Code, and make sure Node.js is installed so you can run commands in CMD (recommended if PowerShell has issues). Start the server by typing node server.js in the terminal, and if everything is set up correctly, it will connect to MySQL and show that itâ€™s running at http://localhost:3000
. To test the API, install the Thunder Client extension in VS Code, create a POST request to http://localhost:3000/users, go to the Body tab, choose JSON, and enter details such as first_name, last_name, email, phone, and date_of_birth, then click Send to save the user. To confirm the data was saved, create a GET request to http://localhost:3000/users and click Send, which will return all users stored in the database. This confirms the API is working and saving data successfully.
