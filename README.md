# REST_API
To run and test the project, first ensure that Node.js is installed on your computer. Open PowerShell in the project folder where server.js is located and type node server.js. If the server starts successfully, you should see a message like ðŸš€ Server running on http://localhost:3000. Next, open VSCode and install the Thunder Client extension to test the API endpoints. In Thunder Client, create a new request, select the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE), and enter the endpoint URL, for example http://localhost:3000/users. For POST or PUT requests, switch to Body â†’ JSON and enter the data you want to send, such as a user profile with first name, last name, email, phone, and date of birth. Click Send to make the request and view the serverâ€™s response. To confirm that the data has been stored correctly, open your MySQL client (phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or DB Browser for SQLite) and check the relevant table, for example users, by running a query like SELECT * FROM users;. You can also test other endpoints and verify that updates or deletions reflect correctly in the database. Throughout this process, monitor the server logs in PowerShell to ensure all requests are processed successfully and the API and database are working together correctly.
